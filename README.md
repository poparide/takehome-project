# Poparide Take-home project

# Overview
We've created a base project for you to work from with the intention of providing a bit of structure and save you time fiddling around with setup and config.

Feel free to deviate from the given base as you see fit. Our only constraint is that you use Django Rest Framework.


# The Assignment
Create an API for requesting a ride on a `Trip`. Implementation is up to you. You are free to modify the existing `Trip` & `Location` apps as well.

## How you'll be evaluated
Think of this like a (very) condensed ticket.
- Documentation
  - Assumptions
  - Scope
  - Next Steps
- Tests
- Code Quality & Consistency


## Time Expecations



# Setup

- install python (suggestion: pyenv & python 3.12)
- run `migrate`
- optional: run load_data for a fixture
